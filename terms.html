                    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, YumCraz's liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-electric-orange">10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    All matters relating to the Website and these Terms, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of [Your State/Country, e.g., the State of California, USA] without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms or the Website shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [Your City, State/Country, e.g., San Francisco, California, USA], although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-electric-orange">11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    At YumCraz, we believe in resolving disputes efficiently and amicably. In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Website, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 pl-4">
                    <li>**Informal Resolution:** Before initiating any formal legal proceedings, you agree to contact us directly at [Your Contact Email for Disputes, e.g., legal@yumcraz.com] to describe the nature of your dispute and your desired resolution. We will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute informally within a reasonable period, typically thirty (30) days from the date of your notification.</li>
                    <li>**Binding Arbitration:** If we are unable to resolve the dispute informally, you and YumCraz agree to resolve any claims arising from these Terms or the Service through binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
                        <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                            <li>**Arbitration Rules:** The arbitration will be conducted by [Specify Arbitration Association, e.g., the American Arbitration Association (AAA)] under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (or other applicable rules, as determined by the AAA) then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org" class="text-electric-orange hover:underline" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</li>
                            <li>**Notice and Process:** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required) or, in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). YumCraz's address for Notice is: YumCraz Legal Department, 123 Flavor Fusion Lane, Tastebud City, FC 90210, Global Foodie Land. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or YumCraz may commence an arbitration proceeding.</li>
                            <li>**Arbitration Location and Procedure:** The arbitration will be conducted in [Your City, State/Country, e.g., San Francisco, California] or, if mutually agreed, in another location. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any relief that would be available in a court under applicable law, including injunctive or declaratory relief.</li>
                            <li>**Arbitration Fees:** Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, YumCraz will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</li>
                            <li>**Confidentiality:** All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>**Class Action Waiver:** YOU AND YUMCRAZ AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Unless both you and YumCraz agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
                    <li>**Exceptions to Arbitration:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. Furthermore, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret rights shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.</li>
                </ul>

                    If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms.
                </p>
