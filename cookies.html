            <p class="text-lg text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16">
                At YumCraz, we use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your flavor adventure, personalize your experience, and understand how you interact with our bold recipes and viral food fun. This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, and your choices regarding their use. By continuing to use our website, you consent to the use of cookies in accordance with this policy. We are committed to transparency and ensuring you have control over your digital experience.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-electric-orange">1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and to personalize your experience. Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser. They serve various functions, from remembering your login details to tracking your browsing habits across different sites. Essentially, cookies act as a memory for the website, allowing it to recognize your device on subsequent visits and tailor content or services to your preferences. This can lead to a more seamless and enjoyable browsing experience, as the website can recall your settings, items in a shopping cart, or even your preferred language. Without cookies, every time you visited a new page on a website, it would treat you as a completely new visitor, requiring you to re-enter information or re-select preferences repeatedly. This fundamental role makes cookies an integral part of modern web browsing, enabling the dynamic and personalized online environments we've come to expect.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The data stored within cookies is typically non-personally identifiable, meaning it doesn't directly reveal your identity. However, when combined with other information, it can sometimes be used to build a profile of your online activities. This is why understanding cookie types and your control over them is crucial for maintaining your privacy. Cookies are often categorized by their duration (session vs. persistent) and their origin (first-party vs. third-party). Session cookies are temporary and vanish once you close your browser, commonly used for maintaining your login state or shopping cart contents during a single visit. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, remain on your device for a set period or until manually deleted, making them suitable for remembering long-term preferences like language settings or login credentials across multiple visits. Both types play a vital role in optimizing website functionality and user experience, but their distinct lifespans and purposes necessitate different considerations for privacy and data management.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Furthermore, cookies can be classified by their purpose. Essential cookies are fundamental for a website's basic operation, enabling features like secure login or shopping cart functionality. Without these, the site simply wouldn't work as intended. Performance or analytics cookies collect anonymous data on how visitors use a website, helping site owners understand user behavior and improve performance. Functional cookies remember user choices to provide personalized features, such as remembering your username or region. Lastly, advertising or targeting cookies track browsing habits to deliver more relevant advertisements. Each category serves a distinct role in the complex ecosystem of web functionality and online advertising, contributing to both the user's experience and the website's operational insights. Understanding these distinctions empowers users to make informed decisions about their cookie preferences and privacy settings.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    It is also important to differentiate between first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are set by the website you are visiting ‚Äì in our case, YumCraz. They are generally used to store your preferences, remember your login status, or track your activity on our site for internal analytics. Third-party cookies, however, are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting. These are often used for cross-site tracking, advertising, and social media integration. For example, if a YumCraz page includes an embedded video from YouTube, YouTube might set its own cookies on your device. Similarly, if we use an external advertising service, that service might place a third-party cookie to track your interests across different websites. The distinction is crucial because third-party cookies are often the primary concern for privacy-conscious users due to their potential for extensive tracking across the internet. Managing these cookies effectively is key to controlling your online footprint.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-electric-orange">2. How We Use Cookies at YumCraz</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    At YumCraz, we utilize cookies to enhance your "Food. Fun. Full-On Flavor." experience. Our use of cookies is designed to make our website more functional, efficient, and personalized for every flavor-obsessed foodie. We leverage these small data files to remember your preferences, understand how you interact with our content, and tailor our offerings to your specific tastes. For instance, if you frequently visit our "Craz Trending Recipes" section and spend a lot of time on spicy dishes, our cookies help us recognize this pattern. This allows us to recommend similar bold fusion bites or highlight new "Spice Craz Test" challenges that might pique your interest, ensuring your culinary journey with us is always exciting and relevant. Cookies are fundamental to delivering the dynamic and engaging experience that defines YumCraz, enabling us to continuously refine our platform to better serve your adventurous palate.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Our cookie usage extends across various aspects of the YumCraz platform:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 pl-4">
                    <li>**Essential Cookies:** These cookies are absolutely necessary for the website to function properly. They enable core functionalities like navigating the site, accessing secure areas, and using interactive features such as the "One-Tap Save" button for your favorite recipes. Without these cookies, certain services you request cannot be provided. For example, if you were to log into your YumCraz account, an essential cookie would remember your login status, preventing you from having to re-enter your credentials on every new page you visit. They are crucial for maintaining the basic operational integrity of our platform, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted browsing experience as you explore our wild bites and big flavors. These cookies do not collect any personal information that could be used for marketing or tracking purposes.</li>
                    <li>**Performance and Analytics Cookies:** These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, such as which pages are visited most often, how much time is spent on each page, and if users encounter any error messages. This data is aggregated and anonymous, meaning it cannot be used to identify individual users. We use this information to understand user behavior, identify popular content (e.g., which "Global Flavor Explorer" countries are most popular), and improve the performance and design of our website. For example, if we notice a particular recipe page has a high bounce rate, analytics cookies help us identify potential issues and optimize the content or layout to enhance user engagement. This continuous analysis allows us to refine our offerings and ensure that YumCraz remains the go-to space for flavor-obsessed foodies.</li>
                    <li>**Functionality Cookies:** These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or region) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. For instance, if you've previously accepted our cookie policy, a functionality cookie will remember this preference so you don't see the banner on every subsequent visit. They can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other customizable parts of web pages. These cookies help us deliver a more tailored experience, making your interaction with YumCraz more efficient and enjoyable by recalling your specific preferences and settings. They are designed to improve your user experience by making the website more convenient and responsive to your individual needs, ensuring that your journey through our flavor experiments is as seamless as possible.</li>
                    <li>**Advertising and Targeting Cookies:** These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These cookies remember that you have visited our website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. This allows us to show you ads for YumCraz content that might genuinely interest you, based on your browsing habits (e.g., if you've been exploring "Hot Cheetos Burgers," you might see ads for other bold fusion bites). They help us ensure that our marketing efforts are efficient and that you receive relevant content, contributing to a more personalized advertising experience across the web. These cookies are typically placed by third-party advertising networks with our permission.</li>
                    <li>**Social Media Cookies:** These cookies are set by social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. For example, if you use a "Share to Social" button on a YumCraz recipe page, the social media platform might set a cookie to track that interaction. These cookies are crucial for facilitating the "social-first" aspect of YumCraz, allowing seamless sharing of "viral-worthy food fun" and connecting our community across various platforms. They help us extend our reach and enable you to easily spread the word about your favorite flavor adventures.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The specific cookies used on YumCraz may change over time as we update our website and integrate new services. We strive to keep this policy updated to reflect our current cookie usage. Our goal is to use cookies in a way that enhances your experience while respecting your privacy. We continuously review our cookie practices to ensure they align with industry best practices and relevant data protection regulations. The data collected through cookies helps us to understand aggregate user behavior, allowing us to make informed decisions about content development, website features, and overall platform improvements. This commitment to data-driven enhancement ensures that YumCraz remains at the forefront of food entertainment, constantly evolving to meet the demands of adventurous eaters and home cooks who love trying wild new things.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-electric-orange">3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In addition to our own cookies (first-party cookies), YumCraz also uses various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the Service, deliver advertisements on and through the Service, and for other purposes. These third-party cookies are set by domains other than YumCraz and are often used by external service providers that we partner with to enhance our website's functionality or to support our marketing efforts. For example, we might use Google Analytics to understand website traffic patterns, which involves Google setting a cookie. Similarly, if we embed a video from YouTube or a social media feed from Instagram, those platforms may set their own cookies on your device. These cookies allow third parties to recognize your device when you visit our website and also when you visit certain other websites. This enables them to provide targeted advertising or to integrate social media features seamlessly into our site.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The types of third-party cookies we may use include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 pl-4">
                    <li>**Analytics Providers:** Services like Google Analytics help us gather anonymous data on website usage, such as visitor numbers, popular pages, and traffic sources. This information is invaluable for understanding how our users interact with "Craz Trending Recipes" or "Global Flavor Explorer" and helps us optimize content and navigation. These cookies typically collect information in an aggregated form that does not directly identify any individual visitor. They allow us to see trends and patterns in user behavior, which in turn helps us make data-driven decisions to improve the overall user experience and the effectiveness of our content delivery.</li>
                    <li>**Advertising Partners:** We may partner with third-party advertising networks to display relevant ads to you on our website and across the internet. These partners use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities on YumCraz and other sites, allowing them to build a profile of your interests and deliver personalized advertisements. This means if you're frequently engaging with "Wild Food Challenges," you might see ads for related culinary products or events. These cookies are crucial for supporting our free content by making our advertising efforts more efficient and targeted. They help us reach the right audience with the right message, ensuring that our "Full-On Flavor" brand resonates with adventurous eaters.</li>
                    <li>**Social Media Platforms:** When we integrate social media features (like "Share to Social" buttons or embedded feeds) from platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or YouTube, these platforms may set their own cookies. These cookies enable the social media features to function correctly and may also track your activity across different websites to build a profile of your interests for advertising or content recommendations on their platforms. For example, if you watch a "Fast Yum Reel" embedded from YouTube, YouTube might set a cookie to remember your viewing preferences. These cookies are essential for fostering the social and interactive nature of YumCraz, allowing seamless content sharing and community engagement.</li>
                    <li>**Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** While not strictly for tracking, CDNs may use cookies to optimize content delivery by remembering your location or network conditions. This ensures that our "Over-the-top recipes" and high-energy food videos load quickly and efficiently, regardless of where you are in the world. These cookies are primarily for performance enhancement and do not typically track personal information. They contribute to a smoother, faster browsing experience, which is vital for a visually rich and dynamic platform like YumCraz.</li>
                    <li>**Security Services:** Some third-party security services we use may deploy cookies to help identify and prevent malicious activities, such as bot attacks or unauthorized access attempts. These cookies are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of our website and protecting user data. They operate in the background to safeguard your experience and ensure that YumCraz remains a safe and reliable platform for all users. These are typically essential for the security infrastructure of the site.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    YumCraz has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers. We encourage you to consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices. Your interaction with these third-party services is governed by their respective privacy and cookie policies, not by YumCraz's. We strive to partner only with reputable third parties who adhere to high standards of data privacy and security. However, it is your responsibility to review their policies and manage your preferences directly with them if you have concerns about their tracking practices. We provide links to their policies where possible to facilitate your informed decision-making.

                    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by setting your browser preferences, or by using the cookie consent tool provided on our website. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, please be aware that disabling cookies may affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. It may result in the disabling of certain features and functionalities of the YumCraz website. For example, if you decline functional cookies, your "One-Tap Save" preferences might not be remembered, or your personalized content recommendations might be less accurate. We believe in empowering our users to make informed decisions about their privacy, and we provide various tools to help you manage your cookie settings effectively.
