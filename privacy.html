                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 pl-4">
                    <li>**Service Providers:** We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them. Examples include website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, email delivery, customer service, and marketing assistance.</li>
                    <li>**Legal Requirements and Law Enforcement:** We may disclose your information when required to do so by law, court order, or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a subpoena, search warrant, or government agency request).

                    <li>**Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We implement a variety of robust security measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include using secure servers, implementing firewalls, employing encryption technologies (such as SSL/TLS for data in transit), and maintaining strict access controls for personnel who handle data. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, it's important to remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You play a vital role in protecting your data by maintaining the confidentiality of any passwords associated with your YumCraz account and by using strong, unique passwords. We regularly review our security practices to ensure they meet industry standards and adapt to new threats.
